  %h2 Playlist Player with Standard+Custom Playlists
  Main features used on this page:
  %ul
    %li single jwPlayer is used here
    %li
      playlist
      = link_to 'RSS(XML) from jwplayer.com', 'http://content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss', :target => '_blank'
      (standard RSS with proper video urls)
      is set as attribute, when creating jwPlayer instance
    %li
      then with
      %i jwPlayer.getPlaylist()
      we get playlist items data and make a
      %i custom playlist
      below jwPlayer div-container,
      %b which looks like its a part of the player, but it's not.
      It is custom made
    %li
      %i custom playlist
      items are rendered dynamically, using small
      = link_to 'template engine', 'https://github.com/yuriyshtybel/test/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/tmpl.js', :target => '_blank'
      and
      = link_to 'HAML template file', 'https://github.com/yuriyshtybel/test/blob/master/app/views/templates/_playlist_item.html.haml', :target => '_blank'
    %li
      %i custom playlist
      can switch videos when you click playlist items

  Conclusions:
  %ul
    %li
      player has its own
      %i standard
      playlist(near Play button), plus we rendered a
      %i custom
      one
    %li videos are always played in single player instance
    %li due to very good styling, custom playlist looks like part of player
